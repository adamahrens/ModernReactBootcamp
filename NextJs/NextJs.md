# NextJS

Next makes assumption about your app. You have a directory called `pages` and each js file located in there creates a route for it.

The `Link` tag adds an `onClick` to the `a` tag. So if you really wanted to you could through it in a `span` which will respond to the clicking of it.

Components vs Pages. Having a navbar you wouldn't want a page for it
